#### Let's do this

### Day 1
My #100DaysOfCode source code is available on https://github.com/xeroxzen/100DaysOfCode 

It's Day 1 I didn't want to burn myself out so early. Instead I spent much of my time configuring my development environment. To ensure I remain productive and efficient I installed 100 Days of Code Pack

It's a very neat add-on for VS Code, it's worth checking out. I figure I will be using the terminal a lot so I also went ahead and finally installed Microsoft Terminal which is highly customizable and handles multiple tabs. #100DaysOfCode
